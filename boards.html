    <h1>Program Objectives for Network Security</h1>
<paragraph>
    Network security utilizes proactive techniques, including defense-in-depth and layered security, to mitigate or eliminate 
vulnerabilities in information systems and to protect against potential exploitation. This may include network and application 
penetration testing, software and hardware reverse engineering, as well as developing exploits for identified vulnerabilities. A 
network security specialist is a professional who focuses on ensuring information confidentiality, integrity and availability. 
Security professionals possess intimate knowledge of critical business components. The Network Security degree reflects the 
application of theory and is aligned with industry standards and guidelines. The degree provides students with the opportunity 
to synthesize and apply the vital skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the cybersecurity workforce. The Classification 
of Instructional Programs (CIP) code for Network Security is 29.0207.
